### Project Number 3
* Project Description
  * "Our project, called 'ಓದು ಗೂಡು' (meaning 'Reading Room' in Kannada), aims to create an online library where people can access a wide range of books related to the  Kannada language and culture.
  * "To achieve this, we have built a frontend interface using the React framework, which allows users to easily browse and search for books. The books themselves are stored in a database hosted on Amazon RDS, and are accessed via a backend built using Node.js. This setup ensures fast and reliable access to the books, and allows us to easily update and maintain the database as needed."
  * "Overall, our goal is to create a user-friendly and accessible platform for Kannada literature enthusiasts to discover and read new books, as well as connect with others who share their interests."
